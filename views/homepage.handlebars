            <h3>Why?... How?... Really?... The True Story</h3>

            <p>
                Every year, the majority of us enjoy celebrating our birthdays in numerous ways. Many of like to go all
                out
                with festivities, parties, or gifts. Others like to keep it on the down low and pretend around others
                that
                it is not their birthday at all, being incredibly boring and humble in the process.

                <br />
                <br />

                For as long as human beings have existed, we have normalized and have created a social construct to
                celebrate the day we were born on every year as a reminder that we are indeed, getting older. I am all
                down
                for celebration. But honestly speaking, the whole "best day of the year" sparkle that birthdays used to
                have
                on me has died. Perhaps I am getting too old? Perhaps I'm dull and boring due to the harsh realities
                that
                aduliting has caused in my twenties?

                <br />
                <br />

                But then I told myself that it wasn't me. I have gone through many changes, but I am still exuberant and
                I
                continue to do the most. It's that the whole birthday celebrations thing has become too repetitive,
                mundane,
                and pointless for me. While I do believe they are still important and deserve our attention, I don't
                believe
                it's essential to be celebrating our birthdays every single year only to be expecting to be doing the
                same
                thing 365 days from now. In other words, it has become predictable and calculated.

                <br />
                <br />


                I miss giving true meaning to celebration-worthy events, but unfortunately, I haven't genuiely had
                anything
                major or unique happen to me that has compelled me to plan a celebration and to enjoy it in a
                fullfilling
                manner. I feel that in order for me to really do all that, there has to be an event that is worthy
                enough to
                be bestowed with an unforgettable celebration of a lifetime. It must be an important milestone that is
                unique, special, one of a kind, memoreable, and different. It must be an event that questions the status
                quo
                and everything that we formally knew. And above all, it must be an event that is of course,
                "EXTRA-ordinary"
                in every possible way to me and to all the fortunate souls that will get to experience this phenomenom
                and
                brag about it to their collegues, lovers, and party-hating aquintances. This is that event.

                <br />
                <br />

                But where did all of this come from?

                <br />
                <br />

                Once upon a time, my nightly fantasies and thoughts kept me from falling asleep as they occasionally do.
                As
                I laid awake that night thinking about my place in the universe or why she likes him and not me, I began
                thinking about my age and how far I have come as a 25 year old. Then, my curiousity took a turn. I told
                myself "if I'm 25, then I must be a BILLION seconds old! Wonder how much that would be?" While I was too
                lazy to do the math on my bed for that, I decided that "seconds is too much, why don't I just count how
                many
                days I've lived so far". I then pulled out my phone, went to google to search for date calculator site,
                entered my birthday down and the date of that day to count the days I have been alive so far. And walah!
                I
                got a big number!

                <br />
                <br />

                I don't remember what day I was when I made that discovery, but when the website calculated the amount
                of
                days I was alive, I was astonished! It was in the realms of 9,500!

                <br />
                <br />

                "So... it looks like I am almost 10,000 days old! I am about to experience almost 10,000 days of life!",
                I
                thought! That sounds pretty exciting and cool. But what day will that be? I quickly re-entered my exact
                birthday and added 10,000 days to the website formula engine, and long and behold, my answer was
                revealed

                <br />
                <br />

            </p>

            <h2>October 21st, 2023</h2>
            <h2>On a Saturday</h2>
            <br />
            <p>


                As if fate already had me destined to celebrate this experience with great people (you) on a day no
                better
                than a Saturday, the weekend!

                <br />
                <br />

                Many of us have overlooked something like this. And I'm surprised this hasn't become a thing yet. If you
                are
                reading this, this is probably the first time you've heard about someone looking forward to 10,000 days
                of
                life and is actually going to do something about it on that day. Like... that's so random? Well, let me
                be
                the very first to do so then because I know when things are worth the attention of celebration. It
                really
                should be a day worth celebrating. It should really be a celebration to bring amazing people like
                yourself
                to come spend an important day with me and be appreciative that we can celebrate that day. And I do wish
                to
                go all in for this...because no.. I am not going to celebrate hard for my 28th, or even my 30th
                birthday.
                Soooo overrated. And yes... I am going to give it my all and thank the Lord for allowing me to
                experience
                10,000 mornings and evenings with the very best of people and make it a night that puts all my previous
                birthday gatherings to shame.

                <br />
                <br />

                This will be that night to remember.

                <br />
                <br />

                And I hope you join me in such a special moment.

                <br />
                <br />

                Thank you for taking the time to read about why I am deciding to do this and I hope you are excited
                about
                this as I am.

                <br />
                <br />

                I cannot wait to see you there!
            </p>
